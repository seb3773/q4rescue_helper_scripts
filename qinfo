ncd="\n${ul}ncdu${noul}, short for NCurses Disk Usage, is an essential tool in the Linux administrator’s toolkit for managing disk usage. It’s a simple yet powerful command that allows you to analyze disk usage in a directory or file system.\nWhen working with large file systems, the ncdu command can be an invaluable tool.\nLarge file systems often contain a multitude of files and directories, making it difficult to keep track of disk usage.\nThe ncdu command can provide a detailed breakdown of disk usage, making it easy to identify files or directories that are consuming excessive space.\n\n${ul}Running NCDU on a Directory:${noul}\nSuppose you want to analyze the disk usage of the /var directory. You would use the following command:\n\nncdu /var\n\nThis command will scan the /var directory and provide a detailed report of the space consumed by each file and subdirectory.\n\n${ul}most commonly used ncdu arguments:${noul}\n\n  -x  Skips directories on different file systems\n  -q   Hides the progress bar\n  -r   Enables read-only mode, prevents accidental deletions\n  -B   Displays size in bytes instead of a human-readable format\n  -X    Excludes files that match patterns in the specified file\n  -0   Prints null instead of newline at the end of each line for use with xargs -0\n  -1   Only scans the specified directory, not its subdirectories\n  -e  Shows empty directories\n  -i  Ignores hidden files and directories\n  -a   Shows files in addition to directories\n  -L   Follows symbolic links\n"
fsa="\n${ul}FSArchiver${noul} is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of a file-system to a compressed archive file.\nThe file-system can be restored on a partition which has a different size and it can be restored on a different file-system.\nUnlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also creates the file-system when it extracts the data to partitions.\n${ul}Everything is checksummed in the archive${noul} in order to protect the data. If the archive is corrupt, you just loose the current file, not the whole archive.\n\nFSArchiver can extract an archive to a partition which is smaller that the original one as long as there is enough space to store the data. It can also restore the data on a different file-system, so it can use it when you want to convert your file-system: you can backup an ext3 file-system, and restore it as a reiserfs.\n\n${ul}FSArchiver is working at the file level${noul}. It can make an archive of filesystems (ext4, ext3, xfs, btrfs, reiserfs, ntfs, …) that the running kernel can mount with a read-write support. It will preserve all the standard file attributes (permissions, timestamps, symbolic-links, hard-links, extended-attributes, …), as long as the kernel has support for it enabled. It allows to preserve all the windows file attributes (ACL, standard attributes, …). It can be used with LVM snapshots in order to make consistent backups of all filesystems including the root filesystem.\n\n·Support for basic file attributes (permissions, ownership, …)\n·Support for basic file-system attributes (label, uuid, block-size) for all linux file-systems\n·Support for multiple file-systems per archive\n·Support for extended file attributes (they are used by SELinux)\n·Support for all major Linux filesystems (extfs, xfs, btrfs, reiserfs, etc)\n·Support for FAT filesystems (in order to backup/restore EFI System Partitions)\n·Experimental support for cloning ntfs filesystems\n·Checksumming of everything which is written in the archive (headers, data blocks, whole files)\n·Ability to restore an archive which is corrupt (it will just skip the current file)\n·Multi-threaded lzo, gzip, bzip2, lzma/xz compression\n·Lzma/xz compression to make your archive smaller.\n·Support for splitting large archives into several files with a fixed maximum size\n·Encryption of the archive using a password. Based on blowfish from libgcrypt.\n"
phrec="\n${ul}PhotoRec${noul} is a file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents, and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures from digital camera memory.\nIt can retrieve lost files from FAT, NTFS, exFAT, HFS+, and ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem.\n\nPhotoRec ${ul}ignores the file system${noul} and goes after the ulying data, so it will still work even if the media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\nPhotoRec is a companion program to TestDisk, an application for recovering lost partitions on a wide variety of file systems and making non-bootable disks bootable again.\n\n${ul}Short tutorial:${noul}\nFirst, connect your memory card or hard drive to your computer via a card slot or USB.\n\nSelect your disk location from the top section and pick your partition right below.\nAt the bottom, check 'free' or 'whole'. If you select free, PhotoRec will simply look for the unallocated files which are the files that have been deleted by the user. If you experience a media corruption (disk/card become randomly unreadable or some files are lost for no reasons), select 'Whole' and the software will perform a deep scan of the card or disk.\n\nNext, click on the 'File formats' button at the bottom to specify which type of file you want to recover.\nThis option allows to reduce the scanning time by excluding some format from the process. In case of doubt, check all the formats and sort the recovered files manually at the end of the scan.\n\nFinally, select the export folder where the recovered files will be transferred and click “search” to launch the scan. Obviously, the export folder must be located on a different media, don't try to export the rescued files on the corrupted disk or card."
